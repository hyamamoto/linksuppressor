LinkSuppressor
==============
	

<code>LinkSuppressor</code> is a lightweight extension that enables an intuitive partial link selection by suppressing Chrome's "Drag &amp; Drop Link" feature. All you have to do is selecting a link with any of [Alt] / [Window] / [Command] key being pressed. Since this extension temporarily suppresses a single unwanted feature, any of the meta information associated with the original text won't be lost when you copy-and-paste into other rich-text editors.

Usage:

* Windows : Press <code>[Alt]</code> or <code>[Windows]</code> while selecting a link
* Mac OS X: Press <code>[Alt]</code> or <code>[Command]</code> while selecting a link
* Other   : Press <code>[Alt]</code> or <code>[Meta]</code> while selecting a link
